# Expertise

Pure text documents I end up using on client missions:

map.org
: Mind map of the project made using org-mode.

journal.md
: A day-by-day timeline of what was done/discovered etc. In markdown.

glossary.md
: words as understood on the domain. In markdown

contacts.csv
: table of people I interact with for the project.

servers.csv
: Servers I interact with

report.md
: The conlusion report, incremented daily.
